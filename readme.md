# PWSH-HISTORY-SYNC-CLIENT

History sync client compatible with PSReadline.

Custom client created with GO that currently integrates with git but could be integrated with much more backends.

TODO:
- we assume empty dir on initial setup, we'll link the remote if not linked and pull down, so add default to backup current history.
