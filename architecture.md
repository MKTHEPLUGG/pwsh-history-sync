### Cloud Storage (OneDrive) Option:
If you're looking for something that can be set up quickly while focusing more on the development side later, you can configure OneDrive (or any similar cloud storage service) to sync your PowerShell history file. You can create a symbolic link (symlink) to store the `ConsoleHost_history.txt` file in a directory that is synced with OneDrive.

Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Move the history file to a OneDrive folder:**
   Move your existing `ConsoleHost_history.txt` to a folder inside OneDrive.

2. **Create a symbolic link** in PowerShell to redirect the history file path to OneDrive:

   ```powershell
   $historyPath = "$env:APPDATA\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt"
   $onedriveHistoryPath = "$env:OneDrive\PowerShellHistory\ConsoleHost_history.txt"
   Move-Item $historyPath -Destination $onedriveHistoryPath
   New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path $historyPath -Target $onedriveHistoryPath
   ```

3. **Install PSReadLine** on all devices if necessary:  
   You would need to ensure that PSReadLine is installed on every device you use PowerShell on. You can include it in your PowerShell profile (`$PROFILE`), so it loads on every session.

   ```powershell
   Install-Module PSReadLine -Force
   ```

### Custom Binary Sync Project:

I'll be creating a custom client in go, I'll be using git as a backend storage system since it's perfect for this and we won't have to design a server.

### Initialize Go project

```shell
mkdir pwsh-history-sync
cd pwsh-history-sync
go mod init github.com/yourusername/pwsh-history-sync
```

### steps of script

1. Check if history directory already exists, if not enable psreadline module
2. if dir already exists check if it's linked with git, if not link it with git
3. Depending on whether it was linked or not we need to push/pull
4. push/pull periodically
5. ...
6. refinement
7. logging
8. security hardening
9. automation with pipeline for building

Go is an excellent choice for building a custom client like this! It’s fast, lightweight, and cross-platform, which is perfect for a project that involves syncing files across multiple systems. Go’s concurrency model also makes it easy to implement periodic tasks, and there are mature libraries for interacting with Git and performing system tasks.

### Steps to Get Started:

1. **Set Up Go Environment:**
   - Make sure you have Go installed on your systems. If not, you can download and install it from [here](https://golang.org/dl/).
   - Initialize your Go project:
     ```bash
     mkdir powershell-history-sync
     cd powershell-history-sync
     go mod init github.com/yourusername/powershell-history-sync
     ```

2. **Choose Git Library:**
   - You can use the [go-git](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-git/go-git/v5) library to interact with Git directly from Go. It’s a pure Go implementation of Git and supports all Git operations like cloning, pulling, pushing, and committing.
   - Alternatively, you can invoke the system’s `git` command from Go using `os/exec` if you prefer to rely on the system’s native Git installation.

3. **Basic Client Flow:**

   Here’s a high-level breakdown of how you can structure the Go program:

   1. **Authentication Setup**:  
      Use SSH keys or personal access tokens stored securely (environment variables or config files) to authenticate the Git operations.

   2. **Fetch History:**
      - Use `git pull` to fetch the latest version of the history file from your private repository.
      - Open and read the local `ConsoleHost_history.txt` file.

   3. **Check for New Entries:**
      - Compare the contents of the local history file with the fetched version.
      - If new entries are found (e.g., based on timestamps or by checking the file’s length), append them to the fetched version.

   4. **Sync Changes:**
      - Once new entries are detected, commit them to the Git repo:
        ```go
        git.Commit(...)
        git.Push(...)
        ```

   5. **Set a Timer or Cron:**
      - Use Go’s `time.Ticker` or `time.Sleep` functions to run the sync periodically.
      - Alternatively, configure a cron job or scheduled task that triggers the binary at regular intervals.

### Example Code to Get You Started:

Here’s a basic skeleton using `go-git`:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
    "os/exec"
    "time"

    git "github.com/go-git/go-git/v5"
)

func main() {
    // Set up ticker to run every X minutes
    ticker := time.NewTicker(10 * time.Minute)
    defer ticker.Stop()

    for range ticker.C {
        err := syncHistory()
        if err != nil {
            fmt.Println("Error syncing history:", err)
        }
    }
}

func syncHistory() error {
    repoPath := "/path/to/repo"
    historyFile := "/path/to/ConsoleHost_history.txt"

    // Open the repo (assumes it's already cloned)
    repo, err := git.PlainOpen(repoPath)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }

    // Pull latest changes
    w, err := repo.Worktree()
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }

    err = w.Pull(&git.PullOptions{RemoteName: "origin"})
    if err != nil && err != git.NoErrAlreadyUpToDate {
        return err
    }

    // Read the local history file
    localHistory, err := os.ReadFile(historyFile)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }

    // Compare and commit new history entries (this is just an example)
    // You can implement a more robust diffing method here
    if len(localHistory) > 0 {
        // Write new history to the repo file, commit, and push
        err = os.WriteFile("/path/to/repo/ConsoleHost_history.txt", localHistory, 0644)
        if err != nil {
            return err
        }

        _, err = w.Commit("Sync shell history", &git.CommitOptions{})
        if err != nil {
            return err
        }

        err = repo.Push(&git.PushOptions{})
        if err != nil {
            return err
        }

        fmt.Println("History synced successfully!")
    }

    return nil
}
```

### Enhancements:

1. **Handling Conflicts:**  
   Implement logic to detect conflicts between versions of the history file. You can either:
   - Append entries from both files.
   - Use timestamps to determine which version to keep.
   
2. **Logging & Error Handling:**  
   Add robust error handling, logging, and retry mechanisms to handle potential Git errors (e.g., if the network is down).

3. **Configuration File:**  
   You can store settings like sync interval, Git repo path, and authentication information in a config file (e.g., YAML, TOML, or JSON).

4. **Cross-Platform:**  
   Go will compile down to a binary for all major platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux), making it easy to distribute across your devices.

By starting with this, you'll quickly get a functional sync client, and from there, you can expand it as you need. Let me know if you'd like to dive deeper into any specific parts of the implementation!
